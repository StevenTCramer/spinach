# Background File Registration

## Overview
Create a background process for registering files with the index, including populating the new file name b-tree index.

## Requirements
- Create background registration process
- Integrate with new file name b-tree index
- Non-blocking operation
- Progress reporting
- Cancellation support

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create Background Process
- [ ] Implement background task infrastructure
- [ ] Add queue for pending registrations
- [ ] Add state tracking
- [ ] Implement cancellation support
- [ ] Add progress reporting

### 2. Add File Registration Logic
- [ ] Implement file validation
- [ ] Add file name b-tree updates
- [ ] Handle existing file updates
- [ ] Implement batch processing
- [ ] Add error recovery
- [ ] Create RepoFileEnumerator in Helpers folder
      - Support resuming enumeration from specific index
      - Track current index during enumeration
      - Handle file system operations safely
      - Implement IEnumerator<string> for file paths

### 3. Add Coordination Logic
- [ ] Implement thread synchronization
- [ ] Add coordination with content indexing
- [ ] Handle concurrent operations
- [ ] Add cleanup mechanisms
- [ ] Implement status reporting

### 4. Testing
- [ ] Test registration process
- [ ] Add concurrency tests
- [ ] Test error conditions
- [ ] Test cancellation scenarios
- [ ] Add performance tests

## Technical Details
- Must coordinate with file name b-tree operations
- Need to handle large batches efficiently
- Consider memory usage during batch operations
- Must maintain index consistency during errors

## Dependencies
- New file name b-tree implementation
- Existing file registration system
- Thread synchronization mechanisms
